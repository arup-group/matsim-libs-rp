# Arup CML's Fork of MATSim

This is a local fork of the MATSim code base. We intend to make as few local changes to MATSim as we possibly can, but
every once in a while there will be something that we want or need to change that is not appropriate to push to
"MATSim central". These Arup-specific changes are handled here.

Initially we created this fork in order to make some changes to the road pricing extension, as described in the
[README of that subproject](contribs/roadpricing/README.md). We should use that as a template for making future
changes to specific modules, for example if we want to do something with the EV or emissions modules.

## Overview

MATSim provides a toolbox to run and implement large-scale agent-based
transport simulations. The toolbox consists of several modules which can be
combined or used stand-alone. Modules can be replaced by own implementations
to test single aspects of your own work. Currently, MATSim offers a toolbox
for demand-modeling, agent-based mobility-simulation (traffic flow simulation),
re-planning, a controller to iteratively run simulations as well as methods to
analyze the output generated by the modules.

All list of available extensions can be found in the [contribs](contribs/README.md) folder.

For more information, see the project website at http://www.matsim.org/.
